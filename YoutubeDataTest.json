    "description": "Whether you have fond NES memories or want to introduce yourself and your kids to the video games that made Nintendo a household name, you’ll love the compact and attractive console. The hub of the NES Classic Edition is the HOME Menu, which can be used to access all 30 of the classic NES games. From here, you can adjust various settings or just dive into a game and start playing. To help locate games quickly and easily, you can press the Select button to sort by title, two-player games, recently played games, number of times played, release date and publisher. \n\nTo make sure every Goomba stomp looks as authentic as possible, all games can be played in three display modes. With the CRT filter, a scan-line effect is added to the screen to give everything that oh-so-retro look and feel. 4:3 is a sharp, clean look that adheres to the original aspect ratio used by the NES. And when playing in Pixel Perfect mode, every pixel is shown as a perfect square, providing the most accurate representation of the games as they were originally designed. \n\nRetro gaming is defined in part by the search for save spots and the need to enter long passwords, but in practice, those tasks can definitely be a little … um … time consuming. While all aspects of the original 30 NES games are intact, Suspend Points have been added to streamline the experience of playing them. At any point during gameplay, simply press the console’s Reset button to return to the HOME Menu and save a Suspend Point that will let you pick up right where you left off. Up to four Suspend Points can be saved per game, so you can track the progress of multiple players or file away your favorite moments. This is great news for parents, as their kids won’t be able to use the “I’ll be there when I get to the next save point!” excuse any more when dinner is ready. \n\nNintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition is a little more than a month away!

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 8\" cake pans and two 6\" cake pans.\n2. Cover bottom of each cake pan with one cup of cake batter, spread thinly.\n3. Cut coloured cakes into wedges. Using a 1.25\" circle cutter, cut the wedge into circles. Place the thinner circle in one pan, and press it into the batter near the center of the pan, and the thicker circle in the other pan, towards the outer edge. Repeat cutting wedges, and cutting circles out and placing into the batter until two rings of bubbles is complete.\n4. Cover the coloured cake with additional cake batter until all pieces are covered.\n5. Bake the cakes in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the cake is completely cooked in the center. Allow to cool completely.\n6. Once cakes have cooled completely, level and stack cakes. Use the hot pink buttercream to fill between the layers, and cover cakes in light pink. \n7. Place three wood dowels into the larger cake and cut flush to the top of the cake. Stack with smaller cake on top of the support dowels, slightly hanging the cake over the edge of the larger one below. Insert one to two additional dowels through both layers.\n8. Starting on the bottom layer, cover the entire cake in gum balls! \n9. Cover half of the top layer with gum balls. \n10. To the top of the cake, place the edible bubbles, homemade bubble gum, sprinkles, and additional gum balls of both sizes. Work the gum balls up the front of the cake and place sprinkles in between the gum balls. \n11. Fill an 8\" round fish bowl with large gum balls and place the cake on top for display. \n12. Slice and serve when desired. Cake is best consumed within 2-3 days and should be kept in the fridge.",

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 8\" cake pans and two 6\" cake pans.\n2. Cover bottom of each cake pan with one cup of cake batter, spread thinly.\n3. Cut coloured cakes into wedges. Using a 1.25\" circle cutter, cut the wedge into circles. Place the thinner circle in one pan, and press it into the batter near the center of the pan, and the thicker circle in the other pan, towards the outer edge. Repeat cutting wedges, and cutting circles out and placing into the batter until two rings of bubbles is complete.\n4. Cover the coloured cake with additional cake batter until all pieces are covered.\n5. Bake the cakes in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the cake is completely cooked in the center. Allow to cool completely.\n6. Once cakes have cooled completely, level and stack cakes. Use the hot pink buttercream to fill between the layers, and cover cakes in light pink. \n7. Place three wood dowels into the larger cake and cut flush to the top of the cake. Stack with smaller cake on top of the support dowels, slightly hanging the cake over the edge of the larger one below. Insert one to two additional dowels through both layers.\n8. Starting on the bottom layer, cover the entire cake in gum balls! \n9. Cover half of the top layer with gum balls. \n10. To the top of the cake, place the edible bubbles, homemade bubble gum, sprinkles, and additional gum balls of both sizes. Work the gum balls up the front of the cake and place sprinkles in between the gum balls. \n11. Fill an 8\" round fish bowl with large gum balls and place the cake on top for display. \n12. Slice and serve when desired. Cake is best consumed within 2-3 days and should be kept in the fridge."

Badalamenti will return as composer for the new series, which will premiere on SHOWTIME in 2017.\n\nBadalamenti has written some of the most unique film scores of our time. He is widely known for his long-standing collaboration with TWIN PEAKS director David Lynch, which has produced a creative and inspired body of work. In addition to receiving the Grammy Award for the theme music of the original series, the “Soundtrack Album from Twin Peaks” achieved gold status in 25 countries. Badalamenti has also received three Emmy® Award nominations for the original series, as well as Golden Globe® nominations for films The Straight Story and Mulholland Drive.\n\nOne of the most groundbreaking and influential television series of all time, the new SHOWTIME series picks up twenty-five years after the inhabitants of a quaint northwestern town were stunned when their homecoming queen Laura Palmer was shockingly murdered. The new TWIN PEAKS is written and produced by series creators and executive producers David Lynch and Mark Frost and is directed entirely by Lynch.",
