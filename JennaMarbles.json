As you saw I literally took my old ones off my phone to put my new ones on, I've been using them for so long now and everyone always asks what they are because they make using your phone so much easier and you can do things with one hand so much better.  Like even taking pictures or snap chatting is just 1000% easier because your fingers are secure around the pop socket.  If you have a smaller phone you can totally just use one, on their website they show different uses and styles of placement for them like to wrap your headphones around or as a media stand like I use.  I stick mine to my iPhone case and they have never come off unless I take them off, the adhesive is very strong.  I will say though that make sure your case is a flat surface, if it's like some glitter rhinestone case it might not stay on as well or as long, I mean that seems like common sense right?  Other uses I have noticed is anytime you have somewhere to hang your phone you totally can like before I got the clips for my pop sockets I was hanging my phone on my bike basket with them which was incredible for Pokemon Go 10/10 genius idea thank you I'm welcome.  But really just having the stand function so I can set my phone on the table and watch stuff in the morning while I'm eating breakfast or doing my makeup is like my favorite thing ever, no more propping my phone up on weird stuff and crying because I can't see it know what I mean fam.  Alright tweet me your pictures and stuff if you get them I really really hope you like them a lot because I haven't had anything for sale in over a year and this is very excitement time in my excitement hands are very an ready.

        "description": "FYI just because I'm sure someone will ask/comment: my dogs eat a regular healthy dog diet, they do not eat many raw fruits or vegetables regularly because they don't really enjoy them.  They do however eat them when they are cooked, and there are cooked vegetables in their dog meals that they like to scarf down, but as you can see they really didn't do more than taste a lot of things because they are an spoiled by an chickain.  AN CHICKAIN OR DIE!  And the lovely collar Peach has on is in fact a dog collar, it was an incredibly kind gift sent to our PO Box by a company/person called Beadie Babies (aw cute), they even sent ones for Kermit and Marbles as well but they tend to scratch or go dogatonic and not move when they have something foreign around their necks so I didn't subject them that since I wanted them to be comfortable to eat.  GOOD EATING MARBLES.  YOU HEAR ME.  REALLY GOOD JOB LITTLE GUY.  Just kidding vrrrooooom F.  But Peach doesn't mind it so I left it on because those pearls really hit me right in the girly feels you feel me.  But I just also wanted to make sure I clarified that so you didn't think I was over here covering my dogs in necklaces to be a dick.  Hope you liked the video, sorry they didn't eat more or try more things, it will have to be an acquired doggy taste for them I guess, but I really could watch Kermit eat watermelon all day.  That guy melts my heart.  Alright good talk see you later byeeee. \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

            "description": "FYI just because I'm sure someone will ask/comment: my dogs eat a regular healthy dog diet, they do not eat many raw fruits or vegetables regularly because they don't really enjoy them.  They do however eat them when they are cooked, and there are cooked vegetables in their dog meals that they like to scarf down, but as you can see they really didn't do more than taste a lot of things because they are an spoiled by an chickain.  AN CHICKAIN OR DIE!  And the lovely collar Peach has on is in fact a dog collar, it was an incredibly kind gift sent to our PO Box by a company/person called Beadie Babies (aw cute), they even sent ones for Kermit and Marbles as well but they tend to scratch or go dogatonic and not move when they have something foreign around their necks so I didn't subject them that since I wanted them to be comfortable to eat.  GOOD EATING MARBLES.  YOU HEAR ME.  REALLY GOOD JOB LITTLE GUY.  Just kidding vrrrooooom F.

But for real though I'm serious about someday when I'm breast feeding I'm just gonna not wear a top the whole time and everyone around me is just gonna have to deal because I think it would be so awesome like what is that lady doin just tits out holding her newborn baby \"breastfeeding\" it looks like she's just galavanting around town with her top off and everyone around me is like yeah she's totally just being a topless pregnant woman should we say something and everyone is just kind of embarrassed like at the DMV I would go to get a new license picture and have just tits out everywhere and they'd be like um do you want to retake this and I'd be like nah dude can you get more of my boobies in the picture though because they're really awesome and I have a baby so like fuck with me though he/she is mad cool and just wants to be able to eat whenever he wants do you have a problem  how are you going to just fight a lady with a baby you monster and then I'll get in my car with my titties and roll the windows all the way down while me and my baby jam out to like some smooth jazz and all day every day I'll just wear cool sunglasses and push them up on my face and say deal with it to everyone around me.  Word.  Also I'm uploading every day on my vlog channel for vlogmas if you're bored and want to see how fugly I look on a day to day basis when I'm doing work at home like ew bitch and I'm like I know dude it's great and someday my skin will thank me and not cry all the time because it's not covered in makeup all day every day and I'll high five it and stuff about it.  Gotta go, tits out for life homie.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

        "description": "I know there will be comments in here about this being cruel to the dogs and what not, please just read this before you leave one of those: I love my dogs more than the world.  I would never do anything to them that was cruel, and the most important thing about doing things like this with your dogs is that you know their limits and work with them to make it a fun experience for both of you.  Any dog that you try this on will likely have a reaction to the initial sensation of being sprayed with something, and why not, it's a totally new experience for them.  For them to be a little fearful at first is to be expected.  But if you watch as the video goes on how much (and how long it took us) to make this a fun and rewarding experience for them with praise and treats there really is no problem.  Honestly in my opinion the nail polish is the absolute best because they don't mind it in the least and it looks hysterical.  I promise you I would have stopped using the spray and shut of the camera immediately if I thought they were getting distressed and if you do want to ever try something like this with your dogs do stop if it's too much for them.  I just really really want you guys to know I would never hurt them or stress them out on purpose and I promise you a million percent that they really had a good time doing this and got a nice warm bath afterwards.

        "description": "Sorry this video took so long to upload, YouTube le hates me.  Some clarification points: this is not Kermit's actual baby for those of you that are confused by what I said, Kermit is fixed, Kermit will never has the babies.  He just treats her like a baby which is very sweet.  \n\nAlso please do not use this video as a soap box for adopting animals, this is Julien's puppy, he is a first time dog owner and he was so in love with Kermit he really wanted one of his own.  I am 100% in full support of adopting animals, I both morally and financially support them and even worked at one for an entire summer in high school.  I know the deal.  That being said, I think we can all agree that people getting puppies from breeders are not the problem that causes the pet population problem in the United States.  It is the population of human being that get them from both breeder and shelters alike and do it on a whim, irresponsibly, even with the best of intentions, but that do not make a full life commitment to the animal and see them as disposable as soon as they challenge their lifestyle.  This country makes it incredibly easy to drop off and unload an unwanted pet at a shelter and they do end up killing many of them.  Saying that getting a puppy from a breeder is wrong is like saying your parents were given a choice to adopt a child and instead chose to have you.  It's not the answer to the problem.  The people that view and treat animals like disposable entities are the problem so I beg you please, do not use this video to say how much Julien should have adopted a dog.  He and I will both likely do that in the future after we are more comfortable with behavioral issues, I am ready to take on an adult dog for sure at this point, however my lease will only allow me to have 2 dogs.  When the day comes that I could have more, I'll rescue any dog that I can (you're allowed to have a total of 5 dogs in the state of California).  But telling people that they \"should\" do something is just not right.  This is his first experience of ever having a dog, he wanted a puppy, and I know that so many of you are passionate about adoption which I respect, but please do not take your anger out on two loving, caring, and responsible pet owners.  Please direct it at the despicable human beings that casually get and leave dogs when they don't want them anymore.  \n\nAnyways, puppies are cool and she is Julien's, not mine, but I hope you love her because I do very much.  End rant.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

The people that view and treat animals like disposable entities are the problem so I beg you please, do not use this video to say how much Julien should have adopted a dog.  He and I will both likely do that in the future after we are more comfortable with behavioral issues, I am ready to take on an adult dog for sure at this point, however my lease will only allow me to have 2 dogs.  When the day comes that I could have more, I'll rescue any dog that I can (you're allowed to have a total of 5 dogs in the state of California).  But telling people that they \"should\" do something is just not right.  This is his first experience of ever having a dog, he wanted a puppy, and I know that so many of you are passionate about adoption which I respect, but please do not take your anger out on two loving, caring, and responsible pet owners.  Please direct it at the despicable human beings that casually get and leave dogs when they don't want them anymore.  \n\nAnyways, puppies are cool and she is Julien's, not mine, but I hope you love her because I do very much.  End rant.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

        "description": "I'm so sorry about doing this, I had a great video planned for today that I will try to make for next week.  The sinks/washer all started spewing water early in the day, I knew that it had to get fixed today because of all the horrible plumbing problems that we had had over July 4th weekend, and the standing water behind the washer couldn't stay there or else it would start damaging everything.  The nature of my shoot/edit/upload all in one day catches up with me sometimes, this happened to be one of those days and I couldn't even begin shooting anything in the house because of all the people I knew would be in here and also needed to physically be present while it got fixed.  For the record, after I made the vlog for this video, my landlord and his plumber came over and were at the house for over 4 hours.  First my landlord came in and acted like we clogged the sink, which is impossible since both sinks (one on the counter and one on this weird little island that we don't even use) were over flowing with water and so was the washing machine.  This was clearly an underground plumbing issue since everything was exploding, just like it was a few weeks ago in the master bedroom, but my landlord came over with a plunger in his hand, stormed in with some chick, and repeatedly asked us if the sinks were \"open.\"  We were like, yeah they're open, how do you think all that water got in there?  After he plunged away for a while making no progress, he waited for his plumber.  Then they were here for over 4 hours not giving us any updates at all, so I sat at my computer and worked on this video while listening to them bang all over the house and tear apart my kitchen.  I guess it's fixed now but I have relatively low expectations for it staying that way, because after the 4th (mind you it took over a week to fix that sewage situation, we couldn't shower/use the bathroom in there) we sighed a breath of relief thinking it was fixed and now the same thing happened again in the kitchen.  This place has been nice for the year that I lived here minus all of the problems, and the fucking cockroaches (like seriously you know you see too many cockroaches when they don't scare you anymore) but I will be moving and significantly downgrading so I can really save up to make an investment in a home.  I don't even know which place pissed me off more, this current one or the last one.  That place was crazy.  Sweet apartment, bitch, it has termites and we all almost died in a vent fan fire.  Then when the sprinklers put it out and everything of mine in the basement was destroyed from fire/ash/water you didn't fix anything.  You left it like that for months until I moved out.  Fantastically amazing stuff.  Usually this kind of thing would be a minor headache for a lot of people, or even a moderate one, but because I live and work in my residence, it creates outrageous numbers of problems for me where I almost have no choice.  If I didn't have to be here while they made all the repairs, I could have gone out into the world and made a cool little video, but I was fucking sequestered here.  \n\nOkay I'm done, and again, sorry for doing this I know you were hoping for a new video.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

The nature of my shoot/edit/upload all in one day catches up with me sometimes, this happened to be one of those days and I couldn't even begin shooting anything in the house because of all the people I knew would be in here and also needed to physically be present while it got fixed.  For the record, after I made the vlog for this video, my landlord and his plumber came over and were at the house for over 4 hours.  First my landlord came in and acted like we clogged the sink, which is impossible since both sinks (one on the counter and one on this weird little island that we don't even use) were over flowing with water and so was the washing machine.  This was clearly an underground plumbing issue since everything was exploding, just like it was a few weeks ago in the master bedroom, but my landlord came over with a plunger in his hand, stormed in with some chick, and repeatedly asked us if the sinks were \"open.\"  We were like, yeah they're open, how do you think all that water got in there?  After he plunged away for a while making no progress, he waited for his plumber.  Then they were here for over 4 hours not giving us any updates at all, so I sat at my computer and worked on this video while listening to them bang all over the house and tear apart my kitchen.  I guess it's fixed now but I have relatively low expectations for it staying that way, because after the 4th (mind you it took over a week to fix that sewage situation, we couldn't shower/use the bathroom in there) we sighed a breath of relief thinking it was fixed and now the same thing happened again in the kitchen.  This place has been nice for the year that I lived here minus all of the problems, and the fucking cockroaches (like seriously you know you see too many cockroaches when they don't scare you anymore) but I will be moving and significantly downgrading so I can really save up to make an investment in a home.  I don't even know which place pissed me off more, this current one or the last one.  That place was crazy.  Sweet apartment, bitch, it has termites and we all almost died in a vent fan fire.  Then when the sprinklers put it out and everything of mine in the basement was destroyed from fire/ash/water you didn't fix anything.  You left it like that for months until I moved out.  Fantastically amazing stuff.  Usually this kind of thing would be a minor headache for a lot of people, or even a moderate one, but because I live and work in my residence, it creates outrageous numbers of problems for me where I almost have no choice.  If I didn't have to be here while they made all the repairs, I could have gone out into the world and made a cool little video, but I was fucking sequestered here.  \n\nOkay I'm done, and again, sorry for doing this I know you were hoping for a new video.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

I tried to fix it but it doesn't really help that I'm super retarded in the head and can't figure things out in like 30 seconds so I got frustrated and ate a snack about it and gave up and googled it and tried again and then gave up again and then did a headstand but I did it on a really hard floor so then I got literally a headache so then I went into the living room and quadruple checked that Law and Order SVU was recording because I was missing it with my headache and my shitty sound and my dick and all that jazz and then I threw up my jazz hands to the beautiful baby jesus and was like hey man look what I can do with these and wiggled them all around in the air and then did my little kicks with my legs that I've been practicing and was like I ALSO DYED MY HAIR and then Jesus said NO YELLING WHILE YOU'RE TALKING TO ME THAT'S SO SUPER RUDE WHO TAUGHT YOU YOUR MANNERS A HYENA and I was like heyyyyy nowwww hyenas are super cool and awesome just look at the ones in the lion king they're not bad at all... oh wait... I'm thinking of... you know what just forget it hyenas are all bad, just all bad, funny, and funny looking, and smelly, and nasty, and rachet as fuck, and definitely not good.  Sorry about that Jesus.  And he was like, nah dude I'm just playing you can talk to me however you want, and then I was super relieved because I felt like he was mad at me and then he was totally just joking around, what a Jesus thing to do, what a great guy that one is.  And then I was like, hey are you single cuz you seem really cool and nice and are tall dark and handsome and totally my type, and he said no Jenna, I'm dead.  And I'm a ghost.  But I'll see you in your dreams.  And then I was like, ahhhhh yes of course, you're way too good to be true.  Also Jesus, sorry you're dead, and he was like thanks Jenna!!  And I was like, Jesus, did you see my new hair I just dyed it myself.  And he was like, yeah it looks wonderful and I put you on this earth just to be a fantastical little butterfly and man are you doing a good job just doing you, and I was like oh man Jesus that means the world to me.

        "description": "Super awesome Kermie Worm and Marble Plushie sale is still going on!! Both toys for $13.50 get them before they're gone forever!  www.jennamarblesblog.com/shop\n\nLegit true story, the last scene of this video (and actually much of this video) was 100% actual things that my brother did in real life.  We grew up at our Mom's house, and we would eat dinner at this little kitchen table together tucked in a corner in our kitchen, really small so we would all be really close together.  We would always get in so much trouble for swearing, even saying things like \"suck\" stuff like that would elicit a \"HEYYYY WE DO NOT USE THAT LANGUAGE IN THIS HOUSE\" and maybe a \"GO TO YOUR ROOM\" we just were not allowed to use bad words at all ever, maybe that's why I grew up to be such a potty mouth... Anyways, one day when my brother was around 13 years old and I was 10 or 11, we were sitting at our little table eating dinner together and my brother just slams his utensils down (mind you my brother was like a 6 foot tall 13 year old, lanky, but still considerably much larger than both of us and inarguably the funniest out of anyone), he looks at my mom and says, \"You know what Mom, I'm the man of the house, I think we can all agree on that.  Therefore, I declare open swearing.  FUCK SHIT FUCK BITCH HELL CRAP FUCK SHIT BITCH ASS ASSHOLE FUCK SHIT FUUUUCK.\"  My mom just looked at him for a good hard second trying so hard to be appalled but just burst out laughing so hard and he just kept going.  She tried to get him to stop and regain her composure but it just was not happening.  He ate the rest of his dinner asking her to \"pass me a fucking napkin\" and \"are there any fucking leftovers\" and from that day on, we still weren't completely allowed to swear, but if we did by accident it was okay because the man of the house had laid down the law and we were just abiding by it.  In terms of poking with objects he was also second to none, one time he duct taped together like 5 sticks and put an L shape on the last one so that he could poke my mom from around the corner.  That ended in her snapping the sticks and telling him he couldn't use the car if he kept doing it.  He was in high school by then.  Unrelated, but one of my most favorite brother moments was this time he was getting in an argument with her, he was like 8 or so, maybe a little younger, so I was 6ish, and he could never ever ever lose an argument.  He even got this cassette tape called \"How to have an argument and win every time\" and would listen to it every day, it was completely obnoxious.  He didn't argue like a little kid, he had this way of just calmly (lying) telling you that you were wrong over and over and over again until you wanted to bang your head on something.  My mom figured out the best way to deal with it was to just walk up to her room and close the door and tell him that she would finish arguing with him in a little bit, and that just drove him mad.  So he stood outside her door this particular time and said, \"Mom, I just want to let you know that this argument isn't finished and you have to come out,\" and she was all like, \"noooo I'm going into my room for a time out, we will finish this later.\"  And he had just had it that day, he was infuriated that she found a loophole in his arguing and winning every time bullet proof formula.  So he started fuming, looking around the house for some way to make her pay for what she had done.  He got a bunch of masking tape and decided that if she wasn't going to come out, she was never going to come out, so he began taping her door shut.  It started off from side to side and he made his way all the way up to the top and back down again, making sure she couldn't possibly open the door.  He sat there with the biggest smile on his face, thinking for sure this would show her to walk away from an argument, she'll try to open the door and realize she's stuck and need his help and lose the argument.  Well the moment came for her to come out, he heard the door handle turn and she pulls (yes pulls, not pushes) the door open inwards and sees this makeshift wall of tape.  My brother forgot to account for which way the door opened.  My mom stood there dying laughing and my brother had lost twice.  Too clever for his own good.  I also died laughing but that's also because I thought everything in the whole world was hysterical.  \n\nAlso this video should just be called \"How To Get Sent To Your Room\"  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

All awesome decorations (aside from the fuckery I brought with me i.e. my ridiculous belongings) were hand picked out by my magical sparkle bear Rome McElroy, this is her electric tumblr http://goose-n-moose.tumblr.com and her fashion instagram is goose_and_moose she's pretty awesome.  And I forgot to mention in the video that the house I moved into is 100% detached from other buildings, the house I moved from was a townhouse in a building of 5 units so that's why I had such shitty neighbors, we shared walls and shit it was the opposite of tits.  But now I'm free free freeeeeee like a bird inside a balloon.  Wait what.  And yes to anyone that asks about the What are This Remix, it's happening don't you worry little angel mice, it's coming.  I just wanted to do a vlog in my new house first so people weren't like, no seriously though what are this and where are we and WHAT THE DICK IS GOING ON JENNA I DONT EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE WHAT IS YOUR LIFE ABOUT THATS THE ONLY REASON WE ARE INTERNET FRIENDS AND IF YOURE NOT GOING TO BE HONEST AND TELL US WHAT THE DICK HOUSE YOU ARE IN HOW CAN WE EVER TRUST YOU YOU DUMB BITCH!?  And so I made it so that you didn't even have to say that, I just respected our internet friendship and was like, I should probably tell my friends I moved and here it is want to come over and make couscous and play beer pong and do all the fun stuff together?  Yeahhh buddy.  I don't have heat or hot water yet also so my hair is going to be KILLING IT for a few days i.e. so thirsty it's dying, and I'm also not getting cable for like 2 fucking weeks how horrible is that shit.  Not cool man I've got mad shit I gotta watch and you're lucky this didn't happen during Luca's reign on Master Chef or shit would have really hit the fan and I would have lost my mind, nothing separates me from that Luca bear.  But for real Direct TV can go and fuck themselves \"oh sorry the soonest we can come is some ridiculously long time away from you enjoying your cable that you pay for because we have our own dicks up our own asses and don't know how to not suck.\"  Oh my god I need to sleep I haven't slept in forever.  Have you ever packed up all your shit and moved?  It's fucking exhausting.  I recommend just not doing it.  Like ever.  Make the house come to you.  Just figure you the space time continuum and do it that way.  Fucking physics man.  DUH. \n\nOkay but will you get me a night light?

I miss my otter where are you ot?  And they call their otter parents on the phone and they're all like mommy otter daddy otter how are you guys doing I miss you so very much you should come to my house and I'll cook you otter dinner and show you how growed up I am and then I'll come to your house where you can make fun of all my dumb choices I made as an otter child and look at pictures from when you were a newborn otter and then you say bye otter parents I'm back into the world and then you go back to your otter nest and sit on the floor and play candy crush.

Holy moly am I doing good, and then the chocolates start doodooing and keep doodooing and doodoo some more all over your board and OHHHH HELLLL NO DID THAT MOTHERFUCKER JUST COVER UP MY CHOCOLATE ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO GET THAT THING DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS MATHEMATICALLY TO EVEN GET THAT I MEAN THE PROBABILITY OF IT IS COMPLETELY NOT IN MY FAVOR AT ALL AND I GOT ONE AND I WAS PLANNING ON COMBINING IT WITH MY STRIPED CANDY A FEW ROWS UP TO COMPLETE MY WORLD BOARD LEVEL DOMINATION AND YOU JUST FUCKING DOODOO'D YOUR BROWN ASS MOTHERFUCKING DOODOO ALL OVER THE FUCKING PLACE AND NOW I'M SCREWED  WHAT THE ACTUAL DICK IS THIS AND HOW DO I MAKE IT GO AWAY FOREVER!??!!  And that's the moment I thought to myself, I'll just stand out on my little balcony, throw my ipad into traffic and that's how the doodoo will stop.  I do not get down with R. Kelly and his poopoo peepee all over you kind of fuckery and I do not enjoy getting doodoo'd on and that's about enough.  I looked out at the traffic and thought about it for a second.  Then I thought, oh yeah I would be extremely pissed off if I was just driving a casual 15 miles per hour to the stop sign and hand a candy crush doodoo covered ipad hurled through my windshield so I decided against it.  But I still dream about it.  Some day I will make those doodoo pieces pay for the anguish they have caused me, like if I was one of those people that just loved to sue people for a living, not the lawyers, like the people that just love to sue people for slip and fall cases non stop and shit, I guess my natural next step would be to just sue those motherfucking chocolates for ruining my life.  Like when I close my eyes I see candy crush and it makes it incredibly hard to have any good dreams where you wake up and are like hahahhahha oh man I'm dying laughing at my dream NO I WAKE UP AND GO  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH R. KELLY JUST DOOODOOOOD ALL OVER MY BOARD WHERE AM I????\n\nI'm in America.  Psych.  Trick question. \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

Anyways for those of you wondering about the fire in my apartment, no it was not of any fault of mine and my landlord/ home owners association has to pay for it since I rent and I am just a tenant.  The washer and dryer that melted weren't mine and the sheets were covered in fake tan so good riddance.  In all honesty it was one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me, it could have happened at any time and I was really glad that I was awake and close to home so I could get my dogs out of there and keep them safe, but I really did also save a bag of cheeseburgers.  I mean you would too don't even judge me.  And also I'm going to australia to pet all the animals and play with them and cuddle them and love them and hopefully make best friends with them so that if I ever go back to Australia I'll have all these animal friends and they'll be all like, hey mate you can stay in my dirt pen with me and I'll be like oh thanks mister wallaby that sure is thoughtful of you and boy do I love sleepovers so give me like a day of flying through the air and I'll be there to make friendship happen with you and then dolphins jump through a rainbow colored sunset in the background and a trout is all like, hey whats all that commotion up there, and we're like SHUT UP FISH MIND YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS and then a bigger fish like a barracuda comes and eats the trout and then a whale eats the barracuda and then Jesus picks up the whale and throws it into space and thus SPACE WHALE WAS BORN.  Nobody take that, I'm actually really excited about that idea.  Thanks.

Like am I on crazy pills?  Because the whole internet bought/illegally downloaded Yeezus, and then shit all over it on any platform possible and I was one of those people that also downloaded Yeezus and yeah the first song sounds like something I would make in garage band sitting in my house at night and then sing \"What Are This\" over it but you know what?  New Slaves is dope, so is Blood on the Leaves, like when the beat drops in Blood on the Leaves it is VERRRRRYYYY exciting if you had not had that experience yet, you should go have it.  Everyone likes to take doodoos on Kanye because he's insane and yeah some of his lyrics are pretty confusical but you know what?  I like to dance around to them and listen to them as much as anyone else and *gasp* I feel like I will get in trouble for saying this but Holy Grail is really the only song I like on the new Jay Z album.  It just doesn't do anything for me other than that song.  Like what is that Tom Ford song?  LIKE WHAT ARE THAT???  He could say anything in that song and people would be like, YEAH FUCK YEAH.  I DONT PUNCH KITTENS I WEAR tom ford.  I DONT EAT THE CRUST ON MY SANDWICHES I ROCK tom ford.  Come on what are that.  The beat grew on me but not really, because I live regular life in regular land and the words \"tom ford\" to me might as well be in a different language whereas \"there's leaders and there's followers and I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\" does much more for me, yes kanye, I would also rather be a dick than a swallower.  You might be out of your damn mind but at least that's fucking english.  LEAVE KANYE ALONE.  He's kim's problem not ours.  Hey do you guys like throwing your dogs in pools?  I think it's the greatest.  They look like little mice on creatine.  pushups.  Dot dot dot com hashtag guitar.",

No, a squidge is a midge that is your friend and a mouse that lives in a house on top of your head.  Not a bear nor moose nor chicken nor eye, you guys you guys I baked us a pie made of ginger and go carts and nippies galore, there should be a bucket down by the shore, for you to have fun it we'll play in the sun and forget all our dicks have these sores.  Now one time in grade school I looked up a cat in the dictionary and was like oh hey there what's this a giraffe or a cat or whose mom?  Like what?  Sometimes my clothes get covered in fake tan and there's nothing I can do about it except for think about my deep seeded insecurities with wanting to be the color \"uhhhh what.... orange?\"  Oh how badly I would love to be permanently \"uhhh.... is that dirt?\" and not have to apply it every day, that would really be fantastic let me tell you because with all the time I've spent slathering myself in brown doodoo colored body paint that lasts a few days I could have written a dissertation on how dogs feel so many feels and have dreams and I can prove it because little worm loves to bark and chase in his dreams and he kicks me in the face and wakes me up when he's having them so that's pretty much indisputable scientific proof in my opinion can I get that cool science award for inventing and discovering shit yet or what I mean come on that is gold.  Also just know that this video has nothing to do with any person named Stephanie, so I'm sorry if your name is Stephanie and now you're all like THAT JENNA NEEDS TO JUST GO FUCK HERSELF I thought a cool name for the girl that talks like that coming from my face etc. would need to be named something jazzier than my name so it's actually a compliment and you should feel electric about it.  Stephanie *does jazz hands* and one and two and three and four now do a flip and oops you didn't make it.  You fell on your head.  That's okay it happens to the best of us.  Maybe that's just what I'm doing right now.  Guess we'll never know.  No that's not true, I actually know.  Because I'm typing this so, I know what I'm doing, what are you doing?  Are you going to answer me or what?  And where the FUCK is my science award thing I wasn't fucking kidding.

And I was like oooo baby oooo baby look at that you are killing it except I'm like kind of your mommy so isn't this weird?  And he said, nah you adopted me so it's cool and I was like, yeah you're right about that much but look out for Jerome because now that he's seen that square little butt of yours I really think he's getting aroused because look at the banana coming out of his monkey torso so we took a picture of it and uploaded it to the internet and looked at it on hot or not or something like that and had people rate Jerome's banana boner but then all of a sudden this little rubber lion came out of nowhere with his like rubbery legs and arms and told us that sometimes lions attack elephants when they're together because they are bored and hungry and all the cool food is gone swimming etc. so it's better to just band together and get us an elephant like that episode of planet earth but I happen to like the one that Sigourney Weaver narrates the most because she really does have quite the electric voice I mean who even knew that she was capable of reading a piece of paper with that much gusto, I really felt her words like deep in my heart, I FELT THOSE LIONS ATTACKING THAT ELEPHANT, not just with my eyes but with my ears and nose and then after I felt it I looked on the table and hey looky what we have here a giant puzzle of a booming metropolis with all kinds of people on bikes and in cars and walking their dogs and so much boisterous excitement and joy look at the fireworks in the sky, have I wished you a happy 4th of July by the way, American Independence day by the way for anyone that is foreign and 12 and what are this it's when the people of the US were all like hey we don't like being controlled anymore because we thought with our own brains about it like ourselves and decided we didn't like it so we're going to do something about it peace out and so they did and they won their Independence technically I believe on July 2nd but we celebrate it on the 4th because that's when ladies with party hats and streamers and balloons said lets light things on fire today like we give a fuck because merica and then we do it every year and eat hot dogs and hamburgers and spin around in circles while we dance to trombones only, occasionally timpanis but mostly just triangles and some trumpets, a tuba I suppose, brass instruments, those woodwinds really set off the melody but they're just so shrill and weeeoooweeeooo if you know what I mean so part of being an American is that we only dance to trombone solos while holding a Bud Light in our hand, or a lemonade, your choice, and then after we light things on fire we kiss our animals and re-shingle our roofs of our houses because hey that water damage up there is no joke and it could give in at any second you don't even know so look out muchacho because that thing is so real and if there was an earthquake we would have to google \"was there just an earthquake\" but the comforting thing about that is that right when you type it in you see that lots of other people have also typed it in so it makes you feel better about being so reliant on technology and then hashtag woooooaaaaahhh it totally was an earthquake I guess it feels different than what I thought it would be like and life is like a box of chocolates, stop eating all my fucking chocolates.

ONE MOTHERFUCKING TIME.  I swear she had it out for me and knew how much I loved Red Fox because at activities period when you were free to like go play in the bins with the buttons and the cornstarch and water that made that goo, or maybe you could go to the art table and draw or you could sit quietly in the reading corner and read a book or hang out with your friend at their desk and put your glue in the pencil groove and let it dry and then peel it out in one piece and then keep like a creepy crawler, well you know what little Jenna did, little Jenna would always go over to Red Fox's stupid little composition notebook and read all the neat cursive handwriting that the stupid other kids' parents would write in all about their epic weekends with Red Fox, oh we went to the movies!  We went camping and fishing, we went to the Red Wings game and got hot dogs and all the shit that I never got to do anyways HERE WAS RED FOX GETTING TO DO IT WEEKEND AFTER WEEKEND WITH KIDS THAT DIDNT EVEN LOVE HIM LIKE I DID, and I would sit and meticulously read the entries to make sure that when that jealous hating bitch of a teacher I had (who I swear never picked me because I was just good and quiet and shy) finally let me take home Red Fox my weekend entry would be the most epic thing that has ever been penned into that motherfucker.  Then one day probably close to the end of the year I FINALLY got to take Red Fox home (after he took a few weeks off because everyone had headlice) and you know what?  My parents didn't even give a shit.  But mommy daddy you don't understand we need to do the most amazing things this weekend WE HAVE RED FOX DO YOU NOT FEEL THE GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION?  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WEEK OF MY LIFE I NEED TO TOP THESE MOTHERFUCKERS!  But I couldn't, all we did was stay in and rake leaves and do chores and we did get to eat pancakes on Saturday, that was cool, but that was it.  And I am not a liar so I had to embellish these experiences as if they were even worthy of being in his epic book and I did it in my own pencil for gods sake, my mommy didnt't write it for me like everyone else.  I came in on Monday expecting everyone to be wowed by my magical weekend with Red Fox and finally have my moment in the sun and GUESS WHAT, during our little Red Fox sharing time we had a fucking fire drill.  A mother fucking there is no fire fucking fire drill give me a fucking break you gotta be fucking shitting me right now I've been waiting my whole life for this shit and I never got to have that moment.  So I just had it now.  Everyone just know that when I was in first grade I had a GREAT fucking weekend with Red Fox.  I loved him, I slept with him all cuddled in my bed and I fucking loved it.  The end.  Damn that felt good.\n\nMerchandise (dog toys, shirts and more):\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop",

Night Shamamalaksjlkjallalalamamayhandyman movies after The Village and like Devil and stuff which I get sort of but for real you should see Lady in the Water and then we'll talk about it afterwards and how it made us feel and things like that because I like it a lot) and so I put down the weight and went into the locker room and looked around and was like, hey there's nobody here, so I helped myself to some of that free hairspray on the counter even though I didn't need it but I wanted to tame my hair like HEYYYYY IM THE BOSS OF YOU NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND so I sprayed it into my hair but it also got in my eyes and confused me as to where I was and suddenly my mind went into another dimension and I was in an alien spaceship which is totally my dream and awesome like what if you got to go hang out with aliens for the day and just ask them lots of questions about the universe and stuff and then when your mom calls you and asks why you didn't unload the dishwasher you can be like oh sorry mom I got abducted like that's a pretty good excuse if you ask me, nobody can argue that one, in fact I might use that the next time I'm trying to get out of something, just say oh sorry I'm on a spaceship right now because these aliens beamed me up through their house but we are still within the atmosphere and I somehow have service but look pal, they're about to probe me with some stuff and plant computer chips that are so crazy aint nobody even know what the fuck they're made out of into my brain so they can monitor my thoughts etc, I gotta go no big deal though don't worry they seem friendly I'll call you back later. Like that sounds like the coolest thing ever. And then once my eyes dissolved all of the hairspray in my eyes I realized I was still at the gym and only one bicep hurt and I also didn't do anything except work that bicep and that was a sufficient workout only for someone that wants one huge bicep which is me so I was like welp better get my bag so I put in the combination to my locker and it was something like 2-24-2 something so easy to remember and then I high fived myself and realized I left a freezing cold beverage and stuffed squirrel in my locker for myself after my grueling one bicep workout and was so pleased that I just got in the shower with all my clothes on and my freezing cold beverage and my stuffed squirrel and then this other naked lady came in and was like hey look at my BUUUSSSSHHH and I was like gross lady it's like got gray hairs in there and stuff nobody wants to see that I'm so uncomfortable so I got out and shaved my head and tattooed 6 more nipples onto my chest and abdomen and felt pretty good about the day and got some lunch. You know? Happens all the time. Squeak squeak goes the mouse that lives in a nest in a cave where are this nobody knows don't read over my shoulder otter. Let's paint things with our peepee together shall wee? Teehee get that joke. Me neither. Barracudas are the angry alcoholics of the sea.\n\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

        "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nMarbles pulled me into a tree one time and whispered in my ear \"I kiss you on the dick\" and I was like woah dude that's pretty inappropriate considering that I'm your mom and your lady piece and we love each other but it's not like that especially since I've seen what accumulates on your dick sometimes I mean can we say DICK CHEESE?  Sometimes it's all green and weird after you get excited or after you get a boner, like whenever you eat food you get like ravenously hungry and need to mount your teddy bear boyfriend and hump the fuck out of his little butt and then you go and lay down and put your leg up and like a little tramp floosie and lick the dick cheese out of your dick (not the jizz because you can't, your balls aren't there and you're fixed now) but like the actual cheesy cheese that comes out of your little lipstick doggy dick and I'm like ewwww marbles, but what's even worse is when you don't lick it and you just leave it there in all it's gooey glory and strut your ass around like you're the man all gross and excited like you give a fuck and then you want to be put under a blanket and snuggled and you always want to make out with me after you do your teddy bear boyfriend which I'm not always sure that I'm down with because sometimes I don't watch you to see if you licked it off your not so it's like dick cheese mouth roulette and I'm not always willing to take my chances with that shit if you know what I mean, I mean given the opportunity to maybe have second hand dick cheese in your mouth or maybe not I feel like I'm going to take the maybe not 100 percent of the time and call it a day and high five myself over my head and then steam some broccoli and go swamp fishing and climb up a flag pole and touch the flag and then say what up to my gym teacher and help him put the volleyballs away before the next class starts and then go to lunch and then go put some fireflies into a jar and then be like hey billy where are you I didn't see you on the bus today are you okay man and then play animal crossing on nintendo ds and then vacuum the cushions on the couch because no one ever does that and then fluff my pillows up and act like that's what people do and then pour a carafe of wine for myself which rhymes with giraffe which ends in e which makes you pee oh say can you see in the name of your d and then we go wee down a slide in grangeeee which is a name I made up for your pup who is a mudscup which is a word I made up and an up is an up and a cup is a wup and look out for that tup HEY BITCHES BE TRIPPIN.

            "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nMarbles pulled me into a tree one time and whispered in my ear \"I kiss you on the dick\" and I was like woah dude that's pretty inappropriate considering that I'm your mom and your lady piece and we love each other but it's not like that especially since I've seen what accumulates on your dick sometimes I mean can we say DICK CHEESE?  Sometimes it's all green and weird after you get excited or after you get a boner, like whenever you eat food you get like ravenously hungry and need to mount your teddy bear boyfriend and hump the fuck out of his little butt and then you go and lay down and put your leg up and like a little tramp floosie and lick the dick cheese out of your dick (not the jizz because you can't, your balls aren't there and you're fixed now) but like the actual cheesy cheese that comes out of your little lipstick doggy dick and I'm like ewwww marbles, but what's even worse is when you don't lick it and you just leave it there in all it's gooey glory and strut your ass around like you're the man all gross and excited like you give a fuck and then you want to be put under a blanket and snuggled and you always want to make out with me after you do your teddy bear boyfriend which I'm not always sure that I'm down with because sometimes I don't watch you to see if you licked it off your not so it's like dick cheese mouth roulette and I'm not always willing to take my chances with that shit if you know what I mean, I mean given the opportunity to maybe have second hand dick cheese in your mouth or maybe not I feel like I'm going to take the maybe not 100 percent of the time and call it a day and high five myself over my head and then steam some broccoli and go swamp fishing and climb up a flag pole and touch the flag and then say what up to my gym teacher and help him put the volleyballs away before the next class starts and then go to lunch and then go put some fireflies into a jar and then be like hey billy where are you I didn't see you on the bus today are you okay man and then play animal crossing on nintendo ds and then vacuum the cushions on the couch because no one ever does that and then fluff my pillows up and act like that's what people do and then pour a carafe of wine for myself which rhymes with giraffe which ends in e which makes you pee oh say can you see in the name of your d and then we go wee down a slide in grangeeee which is a name I made up for your pup who is a mudscup which is a word I made up and an up is an up and a cup is a wup and look out for that tup HEY BITCHES BE TRIPPIN.

The amount of footage that I had to cut out of this bitch was legendary and lets just say there are some ridiculous extras that will come to your face some day so you can lol and I can feel weird about it.  Whatever.  For those of you who have never recorded themselves talking drunk to a camera I highly recommend it, I really got to know my inner Menna Jourey, we talked about hermit crabs, angel mouses, the universe, Jesus' dope outfits, aliens, it was just spectacular, and then when Jenna watched the footage today we bonded over our shared experience and made a baby that is this video and then we named him \"Drunk Explanations\" and we will do our best to raise him with good morals and values, treat other people the way you want to be treated, feed him and stuff which is fun until you have to burp him and then he throws up all over you and you're like honey can you hand me that towel over there, no not that one that's the nice one from our wedding I'm talking about that blue raggy one that we use to dry the dishes with and shit come on use your common sense, and then you wipe up the baby puke but you still smell like puke so a few minutes later you go and throw your shirt in the washing machine but you better not put it in there alone, what a waste of water, so you gather some other dark clothes together because you need to wash like colors at the same time, and you put in a whole load of laundry and by the time you get back upstairs you're thirsty so you pour yourself a glass of water, scratch that now you feel like drinking some lemonade so you drink that and it's so refreshing for like the first couple of minutes and then it's too sweet and tart at the same time somehow and it makes your face feel kind of sweaty so you end up eventually just getting some water anyways and then you're like, honey can you help wash these bottles for the baby and also what do you want for dinner because I'm thinking about starting it soon, should be ready in like 45 minutes and your angel lover is all like oh I don't care, but you know that they do care they're just being whatever about it, so you're like can you please just tell me what you want to eat and they're like I want stir fry and you're like OKAY THERE WE GO WAS THAT SO FUCKING HARD SINCE IM THE ONE MAKING IT and now the baby is crying and you missed Law and Order SVU and the preview from last week looked so good and you're upset but you DVR it every week by default because you're smart like that and know things like this happen and YOU CAN NEVER JUST GET A FUCKING SECOND TO YOURSELF JESUS WHATS WRONG WITH EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE and your chest starts getting all tense and then you're like oh my goodness now I have a stomach ache so you get some pepto but it makes your tongue all pink and chalky and that feels weird and then before you know it it's time to put the baby to sleep and you're really tired and there's no sex and you're like how did I get here?

And he gets sad for like maybe one millisecond but then he remembers how much straight fuckin swag he has and he turns his little butt around into the dog's face and is like, sniff that motherfucker, that's what a real man smells like, and then the doggy does and marbles lets him do it for a minute and then will turn back around really quickly and puffs his little man chest up and is like, hey hey that's enough, I'm a fucking man and I let you test drive it but if you want the real thing you're gonna have to court the shit out of me.  So then they run and play and meeble is always behind the other dogs because he is not very fast and is also a mommas boy and likes to stand by my feet but then he gets his confidence up and makes sure to bark at some small unassuming child that's just minding their own business and playing with a stick or something and then he goes back into the middle of the dog park and makes sure everyone sees him and tells them all to go fuck themselves, I'm the littlest and the loudest and can't nobody fuck with me because let me tell you something, I may not have my balls anymore but when I did, maaaaaan they were fuckin huge!  You would all be so embarrassed and I need a real man in my life none of this sissy shit, somebody step up and impress me.  And he just sort of looks at all the girl dogs like, pshhhh, I'm so manly I don't even fuck with chicks, I only fuck other men.   And all the dogs give him his space because he clearly runs everything and then he sends little ESP messages through their dog brains to do things like go get him croissants and berries and maybe an espresso if he's in the mood, preferably a double but he'll do with a single, and that occasionally even though he's a man he enjoys receiving flowers and balloons that say things like, yayyyy meeble!  and woah so many giraffes here! because that's what real men like so the other dogs do it and then his tail gets all fluffy because he's excited and he hasn't found a boyfriend yet but I'm sure he will, he's just too busy being a single little man at the moment because he's sexy and he knows it.

It would be like that except instead of animals we are made out of pasta and instead of doing things we are glued to a piece of paper and are actually just an art project that a first grader made and got a mediocre grade on it because it really wasn't even that good, like we totally brought it home to mom and she was like, ohhhhhh it's so great I love it!  and hangs it on the fridge for like a week just to make us feel good but then it's the first thing that gets thrown out when she starts getting rid of all the shit in the house.

Just like that.  Squiggle arms are squiggly look at those titties.  \n\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

And the baker felt bad and weird for asking and later that day when he was driving in his car he stopped at a Starbucks because he was feeling pretty tired and needed some caffeine so he got a tall iced white chocolate mocha and sipped it for a little while whilst pondering why someone would ever go on a no cupcakes diet, it's like when you don't eat cupcakes your soul slowly escapes from your body and goes into Dora the Explorer and if we don't all do our part to keep our souls within ourselves that bitch is going to turn into one giant monster and then that awesome song from the 90's The Twilight Zone (you know the one that goes dada dada dada dada da da DA DA DA DADA... WOOO!) is going to come on while she uproots every home and building in the world and eats it and says sassy little things in spanish with her little fucking backpack on the whole time and we're all in this state of emergency while also being like, what is she saying?  I took spanish for 8 years but I still can't understand everything she's saying why does your brain do that to you it's so cruel?  And we think she's saying like \"YUM\" or something in spanish but she's saying \"I'M GOING TO KILL THAT WHITE GIRL RIGHT THERE NAMED JENNA\" and I totally misinterpreted it and then before you know it I'm balls deep in Dora's fat belly swimming around not having any idea what happened because I didn't pay enough attention in spanish class and boy would Mrs. Valerio be pissed at me for it.

And then I would be like, yeah you're right.  Just like Larry and not eating his cupcakes, I can promise you that motherfucker is going to be the first one to die, Dora is going to straight up shit all over his house and then eat it and then be like HAHAHAHAHHA BASURA LARRY!

Sometimes I don't even have to be a dog to be confused, although most of the time when I am confused I am also a dog, don't ask me to explain it it would take too long and I would probably end up telling you some side story about the time I went to Jamba Juice and was all like ahhhhh too many choices but that's not important right meow.  Anyways though sexual, how is your week going?  It's almost over sort of in theory maybe right so that's a plus and then that means you can do weekend things like pull up the weeds in the yard even though you don't want to but your mom is all like JENNA YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULD GO PULL THE WEEDS OUT OF THE GARDEN AND NOW ITS SUNDAY AND THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND THERE ARE STILL WEEDS OUT THERE and I'm all like chill mom I don't understand what's wrong with weeds in the first place, they're just like less desirable plants like what are that?  That's like some Nazi Germany style gardening if you ask me, like they're fucking plants let them grow into a wild garden of eden and then snakes slither around in them and maybe more butterflies will come and be like, oh hey we found this non-discriminatory garden so let's stay here and relax for a while, oh hey there's that girl that we like, and then they come and land all over me especially the monarch ones because oh boy they are my favorite and one time in first grade we got to hatch them from their cocoons and there were like a billion of them and when they finally came out of their gooey sacs we took them outside but they couldn't fly yet so they just sat on our hands flapping their wings like we were best friends with the butterflies and it was the coolest feeling ever until they were all like, nah man I got this, and flew away into the sky never to return back to upstate new york until of course they migrated back there because FUCKING BUTTERFLIES MIGRATE.  How ridiculous does that make you feel.  Because it makes me feel pretty damn dumb, this insect can find it's way across the country and I'm like lost at a Jamba Juice somewhere not knowing how to get home or properly allocate my weekend time so that my mom doesn't get so mad at me when I don't get all the weeds out of her Nazi garden.  Like what the fuck butterflies, way to show everybody up with your little goo brain.  Figure out a car.

Also, FYI for anyone attempting this, it takes deceptively longer to do than you would think, like wtf I got some markers and sat down to draw my life but wtf is life mate.  Know what I mean?  Then I looked at marbles and he was all like, meh not now mom i've got the derp tongue hanging out of my mouth and then i looked at Kermit and he was all wahhh can you turn on my electric blanket because i'm freezing cold and i'm also a spoiled baby brat child and need you to love me every second of every day also do you have some chicken because I'm hungry?  And then I looked at Jerome who was just standing there like the rasta banana monkey that he is judging everyone and felt weird for a second but then remembered how he has a hole in his armpit from people getting too excited about the fact that he's a giant rasta banana monkey and manhandling his body so the little like white styrofoam pellet things that he is filled with (and subsequently make him noisy and not that squishy to hug, more like an old over stuffed bean bag that isn't any fun to sit on and is just there because your parents are like, \"we're not throwing this out because we bought it for you for christmas you fucking asked for it now sit in it\" and so you do but you're like ehhhh i'd rather sit on the floor this is making me feel weird and also itchy) are falling out and I need to sew him up before he makes a giant mess in my house even though he already has somewhat, I guess that's the price you pay for having a carnival toy that lives in the corner of your living room, he brings you joy and pain all at the same time.  Ah, life, just like the great Will Smith says, sometimes I wonder, what you gon be?  A doctor a general maybe a MC ha I wanna kiss you all the time.  Exactly Will, exactly.  It smells like farts in here KERMIT SERIOUSLY?  Come on bro, your butt though, it's so stinky.  I love you.  Hey want to hug and make out?

        "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nThis video is so real life, let me tell you my sweet angel mouse.  First of all, my underwear is legit getting too tight, does that ever happen to you?  Like you put it on and you're like, wait what the fuck my butt.  And so then you walk over to your mirror and look at your butt and you're all like, who's fucking butt is that?  Is that my butt?  Is that really what my butt looks like?  You're kidding.  Oh my god what have I done!!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!? NOOOOOOOOO.  And then you sit in a corner for a minute and cry and feel bad, but then you get hungry so you go to Wendys and get some french fries and chili but then you also pass a Taco Bell on your way home so you get like 5 Doritos Locos Tacos but then you need to get some because your dogs like them too so you get a couple extra, then as you're driving and getting excited about being a gluttonous piece of shit you pass a McDonalds so you're like, a McFlurry isn't gonna kill me, so you stop and get one of those but then Burger King is right next to it and you know what's delicious, Whoppers, so you get one of those and then by the time you get to your house you have so much food in your hands you have to like carry some of it with your face and just hope that no one sees you on your way in so they can stand there and judge you with all the food you are about to put in your body.  Then you get into your house and eat it all like you give a fuck.  Like shovel it into your face.  Then you remember why your butt looks the way that it looks and feel bad, but then after a couple of hours you get hungry again so you get some cookies and take them to the face.  Guys please don't make me feel weird, please tell me this happens to you.  I've even made my dogs fat.  I took them to the dog park the other day and I got all excited because there were 2 other Italian Greyhounds there and they were so cute and I was like, Kermit look at the other Kermits those are your peoples you are going to have so much fun!  And then when they were all sniffing each other they looked all like sleek and skinny like greyhounds are supposed to look and Kermit looked, ahem, well fed.  I'm like that lady in that documentary about monkeys where she would sit them in their little high chairs and feed them people food like spaghetti and shit until the monkey doctor told her she was giving them diabetes and was all like, excuse you miss lady but did you know that monkeys only eat fruit in the jungle and not spaghetti?  And she was all like, whhaaaaa but they love it so much we eat every meal together, and she was pretty fat too so you know she eats like 50 meals a day consisting of nothing but feelings and they showed clips of her sitting at the dinner table with her monkeys and they're like slamming their hands on the table and throwing shit and making monkey noises when she put a plate of fruit in front of them like, WHERE THE FUCK IS OUR SPAGHETTI WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT WE ARE MONKEYSSSSSS!!!!! And she just got all sad and gave in and dumped her whole plate of spaghetti onto their plates and then they were happy but where also throwing it at her like abusive little brat children that never grow up to be contributing members of society.  I'm that lady.  I have become her.  And then not only are my dogs the monkeys but my underwear is too tight.  It's also getting nice outside and I feel like I have a dimple in my butt that wasn't there before and I just look all soft and squishy like I never work out because that's actually pretty accurate as to how I'm choosing to live my life right now.  Then I get sad again and then I feed my face hole delicious food and then give it to my monkey dogs because they are throwing their monkey dog hands in the air and crying and throwing a fit about their spaghetti.  What have I become.  This is by far the saddest description I have ever written in a video.  The North Face is actually the South Face and we are upside down.  Armadillos sit on pillows under the willows we should kill those.  \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

        "description": "Doggy Toys: \nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nAs I sat down to write this description I just remembered that girl that has two vaginas HAHAHAHA like how does she have sex or like put a tampon in there, which one does she pee out of or is it like it just comes out of both?  Does she have two clits and like two whole things up there or does it eventually turn into one thing, like when she goes to the gynecologist which one do they put the thingy thing up to swab or like how does that fucking work?  I'm just filled with questions that I feel like I never got the answer to, so I wish that I didn't know it existed because I have just been riddled with all of these thoughts and feelings about her vagina and now I'm just hanging with no answers, her vagina is like the universe and I'm just trying so hard to understand it but I don't have the answers and I keep asking God like, can you explain this to me?  And then he doesn't answer back because I'm supposed to figure it out myself but that takes so long and is so frustrating because I'm all like EXPLAIN THIS VAGINA TO ME and then I just have to think about it and try to reason it out and I just can't okay I tried so hard and I just cant, there are too many things that just don't add up and I'm having the worst time trying to get this off my brain.  Anyways this video is about what a girls makeup means and all the wonders of being a girl and contouring your little cheekbones and shit until you look like a hot girl, or maybe making your skin look like different skin by piling liquid skin colored goo all over it and then creating a faux glowy dew all over your face with colors and doodoobutter and then you're like, hey boys look at my face you want to make sex with it don't you?  Well you're better off doing that than seeing my two vaginas and trying to figure that one out GOD WHY DO I KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT.  Okay moving on.  Then you put your hoochie lashes on and your cartoon eyebrows and all sorts of stuff that you didn't even know existed like your hookery lipstick or like that dark one that Rihanna wears that looks so dope but because you're a pale white girl with light eyes and light hair and light skin when you do it you look like the opposite of the sexual hotness that Rihanna looks like and look a lot more like Taylor Momson and then you like blame your parents for your bad childhood and have a string of bad relationships where the guy like beats you up and does drugs off of your butt and then you're like, why did my life become this? What choices did I make that lead up to this point, and then you try to rationalize it but then you realize that if you just take that lipstick off you'll be okay.  So you take it off and put a pink one on and you're like hey who wants their dick sucked!?  But then you don't really feel so much like that so you take that one off and put a red one on and you're like, hey I'm not 50 so lets change this one, so you put a nude one on like Kim Kardashian and you're like, why doesn't this look good on me?  Oh yeah it's because it makes me look dead, you know like the opposite of health and vitality, I just do not have the skin tone to make this look right, so you take that one off and you put a peach one on but it makes your teeth look yellow because you like to drink red wine and coffee and stuff so your teeth aren't this gleaming Sofia Vergara shit and you're like, fuck you and your giant fake teeth Sofia Vergara stop being so delightfully hispanic and making me love you etc.! So then you just put some lip gloss on and you're like, alright I guess this works.  Then you get your eyeliner and smokey eye going and your mascara all over the place and you're like I'm so hot can I get into the club now?  And the guy working at the door says, no you have to go to the back of the line and then hopefully I don't have to let you in because you have the crazy eyes and I don't trust you, so you go back there and wait and think about how all your friends are inside and you can't get in but hey at least I did my makeup.  What?  What is this?  The Matrix?  Get out of here apple.   \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

Andything isn't even a word, like haha that andything.  Get it?  Me either).  Coocoocachoo I am the walrus and you don't even know about it yet because you just live in your bed that is also a tent, I saw it in Skymall okay it exists it's a thing, it's a small tent that you put around your bed so you can zip yourself up into it and like shut out your weird creepy roommate when you live in a dorm or maybe you're 5 and you share a room with your sibling because your parents can't afford to have a giant mansion with all these fucking bedrooms WHAT DO YOU THINK MONEY GROWS ON TREES???? and so you close your little tent flap and get in there all like safe and cozy and you also brought your flashlight for activities like telling your stuffed animals ghost stories and you like line them all up and make them have a parade around your bed like wooaaahh look at us we are parading!  And then you remember how when you go to school you never really fit in because your imagination is like waaaaay out there and when all the other girls are like, hey Jenna want to play house?  And you respond with, lets play kitties except we're space kitties that have wings and we eat bananas and we have to go to the bathroom all the time but we do it on the swings but we're also like super smart and can make bikes move all by themselves and wear hats that tell us what time it is!!  And the other girls are like, we're not going to play with you because you're too weird.  So then you sit under the jungle gym in the wood chips by yourself and think about how Peter was picking his nose earlier and it was gross but on the plus side there are pizza nuggets for lunch today and boy I'm really looking forward to that, maybe some chocolate milk, or maybe I'll get a grilled cheese I don't even know I'm just very excited.  Then you realize how horribly alone you are, so then the bell rings and Mrs. Walker is like, everyone come inside recess is over, so you go because you're like so good at following rules and are very shy and scared of authority and a good kid and go through the rest of your day not really talking to anyone but you get to sit with your friend Brittany at lunch but you're pretty sure she's only friends with you because she likes your shoes a lot because they're sambas, so then the day is over and you go to get on your but oh my god I almost go on the wrong bus what a careless mistake it's Tuesday not Thursday you have piano later and not gymnastics haha how silly of me to forget, so you ride the bus all the way to your house and you sit there alone and look out the window and think about the trees and stuff and you're like the last stop and your bus driver is so nice his name is Pedro and he has long hair that looks pretty dirty but whatever he smiles and makes jokes and when it's that time when you have to go over the safety procedures he always makes it as fun as possible and you appreciate that, he also likes to call you Juana which you think is funny because it's Spanish and nobody else calls you that, he's also supposed to drop you off like way at the end of the corner but since you're the last stop and he likes you because you're always really quiet and good he sometimes just drops you off right at your house which is so thoughtful of him, sometimes he wears really exciting pants and has a leather jacket which you think is cool.  \nSEE OOPS IM IN IRELAND FOR PART 2\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

        "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nPART 2 FROM WHITE LIES VIDEO: Then you get home and you're like, ehh I'm kind of hungry lets see what's in the refrigerator, and on your way there you see a note with a sticker on it from your mom that's like, hey sweetie I hope you had a great day at school please empty the dishwasher you little fucker, I love you!  See you later.  And you get like warm tingly feelings because you love your mom so much but fuck I really don't want to empty the dishwasher so you put it off for later because you're like, I have around 2 and half hours until she gets home so I can watch some TRL and eat a snack and I'll do it later.  So you go into the freezer and hey oh my god bagel bites I thought Devin ate them all, but they were like sort of squished in the back so you were all excited that you found them so you make them and go sit on the floor in front of the tv and eat them and watch N*SYNC and oh my god you have the biggest crush on them because they're so hot and sing and dance and topics of their songs include love and they say things like, giiiiirrrrl, and that really gets you going but that one with the curly frosted hair is your favorite because he is the hottest one and sings all the main parts in the songs so you like him the most.  His name is Justin Timberlake and you wish really bad he would just be your boyfriend already, he would totally like you so much and you could go to Twelve Corners and get pizza together at Great Northern Pizza Kitchen and get that one that's got like potato and cheese and sour cream and bacon on it that's your favorite, surly it would be his too, and then since he's older he could drive you to band practice in his car so this would work out great.  Then all of a sudden its like 5:15 HOW DID THE TIME GO BY THAT FAST?? and you hear your mom coming in the door and you're so excited to see her because you love your mommy so much but FUUUUCKKK I DIDNT EMPTY THE DISHWASHER so you go over there and start unloading them and she's all like, ugh Jenna I asked you to do one thing, and you're all like I'm sorry mom I'm doing it nowww!! ahhhhh I don't like getting in trouble and you feel all weiiiirrrdd!! noooooo.  But then she's like it's okay, I'm going to make tacos for dinner how does that sound and you're like yayyy I love tacos and you help her like cut up the vegetables and stuff and she cooks the meat and you have a nice time talking about your days together and then you sit down for dinner and you pour yourself a glass of orange juice even though its dinner time because it's just so delicious and you cannot get enough of it.  Then you watch some tv together and laugh and then she has to go and ruin it and be like, did you do your homework, and you're like MOM ILL DO IT LATER I DONT WANT TO WE ARE HAVING SUCH AN ENJOYABLE TIME TOGETHER I hate school and my teachers aren't fair with all this work what the fuck I'm learning why do I have to learn so much my brain is tired and Full House is on come on.  So then she trusts you and is like okay do it when you want, but then later you're really sorry you didn't do it earlier because it takes longer than you anticipated and is really boring and miserable so you sort of half ass it.  Then you get ready for bed and brush your teeth and stuff and are like, goodnight mom love you, and she's like I love you too and you get into your bed that has sheets with fish on them because you like their fun colors and you get all snuggly with your stuffed animals and zip yourself up into that tent thing that you wish you had but don't.

See you later.  And you get like warm tingly feelings because you love your mom so much but fuck I really don't want to empty the dishwasher so you put it off for later because you're like, I have around 2 and half hours until she gets home so I can watch some TRL and eat a snack and I'll do it later.  So you go into the freezer and hey oh my god bagel bites I thought Devin ate them all, but they were like sort of squished in the back so you were all excited that you found them so you make them and go sit on the floor in front of the tv and eat them and watch N*SYNC and oh my god you have the biggest crush on them because they're so hot and sing and dance and topics of their songs include love and they say things like, giiiiirrrrl, and that really gets you going but that one with the curly frosted hair is your favorite because he is the hottest one and sings all the main parts in the songs so you like him the most.  His name is Justin Timberlake and you wish really bad he would just be your boyfriend already, he would totally like you so much and you could go to Twelve Corners and get pizza together at Great Northern Pizza Kitchen and get that one that's got like potato and cheese and sour cream and bacon on it that's your favorite, surly it would be his too, and then since he's older he could drive you to band practice in his car so this would work out great.

I wish I had my mom to like go for me, but even when I was a kid I would always go with her because I thought it was like the most fun place ever but we weren't allowed to ask for anything, that's what she told us, she said \"if you ask for something then you get nothing.  If you ask for nothing then maybe I'll get you a surprise.\"  So me and my brother would just go around stores and like never ever ask for anything and be really good and then when we got to the register she would like get us a pack of gum and we would be like OOHHH MY GOD DEVIN WE DID IT WE WERE SO GOOD AND MOM GOT US THIS GUM AND WE DIDNT HAVE ANY GUM BEFORE BUT NOW WE DO AND WE ALSO LOVE GUM THIS IS SO GREAT MOM IS THE BEST AND SO ARE WE AND WE HAVE GUM!!! Yayyyy!  And we would help her carry all the groceries inside and put them in the fridge and stuff and stop squishing the bread and then we would make dinner and stuff together because we were so good at helping and had gum too we were so happy.  So if I could like have that again that would be great because you know what?  Then I wouldn't be sitting here all hungry with no bread and no cheese and no lunch.  I don't even want a grilled cheese anymore.  I kind of feel like I want a salad or something, maybe some fruit, fruit is great and delicious and it's like cold which is refreshing because it's a little warm out today.  I could also eat some soup because soup is always a good lunch meal, just like nommy and warm and makes you feel like yay soup!  Then I could like share some food with my dogs instead of torturing them like I did in this video. I feel pretty bad about it.

Not a hot one, tell you that much.  NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO WANT TO FUCK THIS DOODOOBUTTER ARM!  Is there any way your arm could maybe fuck itself?  Like not go fuck itself in the way that you tell people that are assholes, like actually fuck itself?  It can't right because of that useless thing called anatomy where your elbow and wrist decide they're not going to be like cool go-go gadget arm joints they're just going to be stupid hingey joints that only go where they want and not where I want.  Hey joints, we share a body it's not all about you, what about what I want?  I'm talking to you knee, what if I want you to go in circles and backwards so I can walk with backward legs like that alien in Signs.  Huh?  Fucking selfish ass fuckers, just absolutely no regard but anyone but themselves and \"where they want to go in life.\"  I got news for you, YOU CANT JUST MOVE FORWARD AND BACKWARD FOREVER, what about side to side?  Bitch ass.  Anyways this video is about some better names for animals like how pugs are squished up dirty khaki pants and sloths are tree pedophiles and rhinos are horny hippos with nose boners and shit like that.  Like I give a fuck.  You know who actually does give a fuck and is super self conscious about it?  Kermit.  Don't tell him I told you but he has this electric blanket that he loves because he gets chilly all the time with his fucking 0% body fat (fuck you Kermit) and almost no fur so I turn it on for him and he loves to sit in and on and around it under it whatever the fuck he wants and it's on a timer and when it goes off he comes and claws and cries at my leg for me to go back, turn the blanket back on, and tuck him into it.  Can you even fucking believe that?  Like just let that sink in for a second.  What a needy little child he is, he knows he's needy too that's why when there's company at the house he tries to show off by giving them kisses and then he gets excited and tries to impress them by playing with toys and running around and then he gets insecure and needs to be tucked back into his blanket.  He's like that hot girl that you meet and you think she's like maybe sort of normal but then you find out she has lots of unresolved daddy issues.  That was an awfully sad comparison.  Taint sandwiches nom nom nom.  If there was a place called dick mountain would you go?  Because I would.  I'm already there.  Bacon tape.\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

But I still ran through that sprinkler like a motherfucker and then we got a slip n slide for a little but my brother broke it because he was too tall and big and my mom said it was too dangerous and that one of us was going to hurt ourselves so we threw it out but we wound up just hurting ourselves anyways playing with rocks and being assholes YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?  FUCKING ASSHOLES.  This video is about when you get drunk and what your drunk name is and how you just switch the first letter of your first and last name and ball the fuck out and then you are all like woooaaah I'm being so menna right now sorry everyone in the room for my assholery and then they try to forgive you but they can't because they are people that take life way too seriously.  I happen to thoroughly enjoy people when they are their drunk alter egos because they get all buck and shit and then everyone gets cake and tacos from the trucks up the street and we are like yo who has cash?? Lets get street meat.  Why are totem poles so smug?  Like stop judging me, who do you think you are, Jerome?  If assholes are balloon knots are vaginas sideways spaceships?  I think so.

        "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop/\n\nHey friendship you know what I was thinking about?  What if there were no such thing as \"taco night\" what if there was just taco forever? Like all we ever ate was tacos?  I mean we could have so many choices, there's meat of course like we could have beef tacos or chicken tacos or fish tacos, but then don't even get me started on all the different kinds of like delicious veggie tacos we could have.  We could make like dessert tacos with ice cream and all kinds of crazy stuff like sprinkles and fuckin gummy bears I mean lets do it and let our imaginations just run wild.  Doesn't that sound like an epic way to spend the rest of our lives together?  Like just inventing tacos like a couple of bad ass mother fuckers.  Indeed.  This video doesn't have anything to do with tacos, although it probably should.  Tacos should from here on out be incorporated into everything that I do.  I have a tinkle taco in my pants, do you?  Maybe you have a pen15 and you're in the pen15 club?  That's a cool club that I've never been able to be a part of because I don't have a pen15 but from what I hear it's really fun and cool and nothing like boy scouts, if anything it just blows that right out of the water.  I totally abused the fuck out of my hair all day today and now it's really angry at me so I put some coconut oil in it because Jesus straight up made that shit with his bare hands and was like, here you go motherfuckers, you'll never have anything better than this shit.  You're welcome.  And then he climbed up into his spaceship while he gave everyone the finger and zoomed off to heaven.  Anyways I did a bunch of stuff to my hair, not all of this video makes sense but that's because my brain is so confusing on the inside you know?  Like I'm just all trapped inside here and I don't know how to get out or make it stop being so weird.  I can't stop.  Won't stop. Eh eh eh eh.  P Diddy.  Who are the 5 best rappers in the world?

            "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop/\n\nHey friendship you know what I was thinking about?  What if there were no such thing as \"taco night\" what if there was just taco forever? Like all we ever ate was tacos?  I mean we could have so many choices, there's meat of course like we could have beef tacos or chicken tacos or fish tacos, but then don't even get me started on all the different kinds of like delicious veggie tacos we could have.  We could make like dessert tacos with ice cream and all kinds of crazy stuff like sprinkles and fuckin gummy bears I mean lets do it and let our imaginations just run wild.  Doesn't that sound like an epic way to spend the rest of our lives together?  Like just inventing tacos like a couple of bad ass mother fuckers.  Indeed.  This video doesn't have anything to do with tacos, although it probably should.  Tacos should from here on out be incorporated into everything that I do.  I have a tinkle taco in my pants, do you?  Maybe you have a pen15 and you're in the pen15 club?  That's a cool club that I've never been able to be a part of because I don't have a pen15 but from what I hear it's really fun and cool and nothing like boy scouts, if anything it just blows that right out of the water.  I totally abused the fuck out of my hair all day today and now it's really angry at me so I put some coconut oil in it because Jesus straight up made that shit with his bare hands and was like, here you go motherfuckers, you'll never have anything better than this shit.  You're welcome.  And then he climbed up into his spaceship while he gave everyone the finger and zoomed off to heaven.  Anyways I did a bunch of stuff to my hair, not all of this video makes sense but that's because my brain is so confusing on the inside you know?  Like I'm just all trapped inside here and I don't know how to get out or make it stop being so weird.  I can't stop.  Won't stop. Eh eh eh eh.  P Diddy.  Who are the 5 best rappers in the world?  Dylan dylan dylan dylan dylan.  Babs can come too but Choppa is definitely overrated.  Let me know if you feel trapped inside your brain too because I can't be the only one.

I have a really important confession to get off my chest and please don't judge me... deep breath, okay.  I ate a cookie yesterday.  NOOOOO!!! FML.  Hey is that a spaceship?  Like I give a fuck.  Just kidding I so do, I want to see an alien like real bad.  REAL BAD.  Anyways this video is about some things that hip hop taught me part two because I liked making the first one so much I decided to make another one.  I talk about Kanye, Kendrick Lamar, Lloyd, Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Eminem, Chris Brown, Akon, John Hart, 2 Chainz, Juicy J, Cam'ron, Cash Out, Salt N Pepa, Outkast, Jay-Z, Petey Pablo, and Tyga among others and all of the wonderful things they have taught me in life, like being straight forward and honest in your relationships and sexual partners, not feeding people you don't care about, lying, you a stupid ho, and much more.  I was also pondering in my brain (not in the video) that if One Direction were a group of giraffes would everyone still think they were so hot?  I mean think about all those awkward necks and legs and hooves and black tongues.  Long ass black tongues licking their mouths into their super high microphones.  Would you still want to tap that?  Yeah, I guess I would too.  Just wondering what your opinion was because I felt bad at first but I was hoping you felt the same way, I'm glad you do.  Anyways, the other night I sat down to do a puzzle and realized how boring they are after you finish all the edge pieces.  Like what the fuck if I wanted to look at a picture I'll look at the fucking box.  This is too much work.  Like penises.  FLOWERS.\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

And you were all like yeah please I love food, so I got you some chicken wings and a pizza and then we hugged for a minute and then went roller skating through my moms house and she was like NO ROLLERSKATING IN THE FUCKING HOUSE so we stopped and went outside to play basketball but I'm so bad at it and you beat me.  Remember that?  How are you?  It's been like 5 and a half hours since that happened.  Here are some extra clips from some of my videos in 2012, the Tips for Good Hygiene extras obviously are not from 2012 but I realized I had never used them before and they made me lol so I just put them in there LIKE I GIVE A FUCK.  I hope your nipples are doing great etc, tell your cat I said hello and save me some cookies for when I come over and talk shit to your hamster.  Know what I mean?  I'm very disappointed about the aliens not coming to my apocalypse party.  They totally RSVP'd that they would be there and blew me off.  That's it aliens, we are done.

Apparently being a grown up turned out to be pretty weird?  Things that also got placed in my tree include a dope ass disguise mask, kermit's santa costume, and a fucking useless $2 bill that someone gave to me as change and then the next day i realized what it was and was PISSED.  Now it just sits on my mantle, it's cool.  I just wanted to buy a lollipop with it, you know?  Also, during this whole video some guy was sexting Courtney the whole time, get it girl.  Yes also it is true that Max and I broke up, it's pretty sad.  But you don't have to be sad because we're friends, we just needed to break up for now and if we are meant to be together I'm sure we will.  Will you bring me some ice cream and we can hang out together and talk about polar bears and stuff?  That would be really fun, I would like it a lot.  So would Marbles, Kermit will probably be doing his own thing because he cray.  You guys, I also ate taco bell immediately followed by regret.  Who knows where spaceships go?  Aliens.  Who knows where aliens are?  Kittens.  \n\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

Pee pee.  At least it doesn't sound like poop, or someone peeing out their butt.  This week I wanted to do something that would give me the lols because I'm fucking selfish, you know?  Sometimes you gotta just be like, hey internet I know you like cool videos that make you laugh but I want to laugh.  Right meow.  In this case it just so happened to include me getting shocked many many times and now my finger feels weird.  Should I see a doctor?  Haha doctors are for cats.  Anyways Max and I actually sang a bunch of songs and zapped each other with these little gun lighter things that we found at the liquor store up the street, the guy who works there is our friend.  His name is Sam.  Hi Sam.  Sam keeps these gun lighters right in front of the cash register so when you're going to check out you just automatically pick them up and are like, hey oh my god look at this awesome toy I want to play with it while I wait in line, and then you look at Sam and you're all like, nothing bad is going to happen if I pull this trigger right Sam and he's all like, no no hunny try it it's really cool, so I do and get my finger zapped in front of lots of people in the store and feel weird after I yelp in pain.  I figured I would just do that same thing whilst singing songs in front of the internet.  Then I bought a juice and some snacks and was like, see you later Sam and he was like bye hunny.  He's really nice you should visit him.  Nice people are nice.  Marbles is a firework.  Titties are excellent pillows.  Jenga is a noisy game.  One two three four hey everybody look at that German Shepard with his ass in that guy's face.

I am those children.  Every night.  Forever.  The end.  Some highlights of this video include my inability to be a real adult.  Hey who's excited for thanksgiving?  I may or may not be cooking a giant turkey so if you want to come over and share with me that would be fantastic we can tell each other knock knock jokes until we pass out from tryptophan (it's the amino acid in turkey that makes you sleepy, not drugs.

        "description": "In this video I describe and show how I made our unbelievably epic Halloween Costumes.  I was always Britney Spears in the past, but I decided I didn't want to be half naked and that I wanted to light the fuck up, like a beacon of Jesus rainbow light sparkling in the night.  We decided to be Chaz Michael Michaels and Jimmy Macelroy from Blades of Glory (although North and South Korea was a close second place, come on you would have laughed so hard if we did that.  There's always next year).   We wanted to be the ones at the end when they light up and do the Iron Lotus, if you have not seen this movie you are just missing out on life. \n\nThese costumes were made from Thursday morning through Saturday afternoon.  We spent the day Thursday getting all of the materials so we wound up with about a 48 hour total construction time for both costumes.  I sewed both body suits from scratch with fabric that I bought at a fabric store on Thursday night from around 7pm until the early hours of the morning and Max hand drew all of the designs on both.  He cut the lights out of the tutus and glued on some rhinestones and we took a nap for about 3 hours before starting again Friday morning.  On Friday I constructed both collars, belts, and four boot covers all from fabric and foam while Max put the lights into both suits and glued rhinestones on everything.  On saturday morning I sewed our arm covers and made final finishing touches before getting out the door at 5pm to make it to our Halloween party.  We put our iPhones into our belts with Rave apps on them (I literally just went to the app store and looked up \"rave,\" anything that would light up and look cool, we actually wound up choosing two different ones) and we looked fucking boss.\n\nAside from ending up with two ridiculously cool costumes, we won Best Couple Costume at the party and got this really cool mexican tile with a skeleton bride and groom which I thought it was an awesome prize.  I hope this video inspires you to say \"fuck yourself Halloween costume store\" and make something on your own.  Even if you get a hot glue gun and some safety pins you can surely make yourself an epic costume.  Also, titties. \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

Some of the lies include being undefeated at beer pong, various physical tasks like sit ups push ups bench press, being facebook friends with girls, telling a girl she doesn't look fat, wanting to watch The Notebook, hanging out with your girlfriends family/parents, how many girls they've hooked up with, porn, strippers, penis size, crying, how much they can drink, playing playstation and xbox, not knowing who Justin Bieber is, and engaging in activities that would been percieved as less than masculine.  Kermit is also a baby deer in this video and Marbles is plotting the destruction of earth with his giant brain (well, giant only in comparison with the rest of his body, it's really like the size of a walnut.  And in comparison with his dick it's nothing because Marbles is packing HEAT in the pants.  That's my boy!  *High fives the Marble enthusiastically* )  My personal favorite part is the end when I'm wearing the Tinkerbell shirt because I couldn't stop laughing when we were filming it.  That's also the shirt I wore in my first interview ever, I believe it's called \"Jenna Marbles has 'No Fear, No Shame'\" at a local TV station in Boston.  The lady interviewing me totally didn't get how much of a joke that shirt was, it's a child sized night gown I bought at Target.  It still makes me laugh every time.  DING.  Giraffes make hamburgers in their free time.  Do you guys like these descriptions?  I figure it's a better way to make the ridiculous tags that I used to do all the time and then YouTube changed their format so you can't see them anymore and it's just SCREWING MY WHOLE SHIT UP so I'm going back and putting them in all of my videos.  Like little love notes to my internet friends.  If you don't like them then I would be happy to personally apologize to your face.  Not.

        "description": "Doggy Toys:\nhttp://jennamarblesblog.com/shop \n\nHey there sexual friend, in this video I talk about some of the things in life that I just flat out suck at (and there are so many, we really just touched the tip of the iceberg here).  Some of those things include basketball, laundry, estimating numbers, history, painting my nails on my right hand, doing my hair and eyeliner, and saying no to my dogs when they want to nom the delicious cheese that I have in my hand.  I am a terrible doggy mother, but at least they never have to grow up to be contributing members of society so I guess it's not that bad.  I think it's cool to just let people know, hey I fucking suck at that, so then you will be a thousand times less embarrassed when they see just how bad you are at it.  It also helps other people realize that you are in fact a human and not a robot with robotic arms and crazy robot eyes that wants to eat all the eggs from your refrigerator and use all your toilet paper for headdress making.  Know what I mean?  Okay good.  I hope this video helps you realize that you don't have to be good at everything and that sometimes sucking at stuff is actually pretty funny.  Come on, how bad do you want to play me in basketball now that you know how terrible I am at it?  Exactly.  Rasta banana monkey says \"where's the bank?\"\n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!

If so then I can just go ahead and check \"owning a floor length leather jacket\" off my bucket list.  Sick.  Anyways though, if I'm in the Matrix, then so are you, and I suppose that wouldn't change the contents of our conversation (which is totally one sided at the moment, are you even going to say anything!?  Gee golly gosh jellybean).  But yeah this video is about that little moment that usually happens at some point when you are getting to know someone, at least in my experience, even if it's a friend, that either turns you completely off from them or you decide that they are el chupacabra or whatever that word is.  Hopefully you habla espanol or else we're all in trouble because there are spiders in this banana field where our car broke down and if you don't espeako the spanisho to that hombre over there WE WILL NEVER GET OUT AND THE SPIDERS ARE GOING TO EAT US!  (that actually happened to me in Costa Rica when I was in like 7th grade, I digress).  Some make or break relationship moments for me include finding out someone doesn't floss their teeth, cut their toenails, have a baby koala farm, are a model... airplane, have two dicks, or perhaps three dicks, have two vaginas, or pee out of their belly button among other things.  I've been getting a lot of smack talking about the quidditch comment and yes I do sort of agree, and you know I love me some Harry Potter like there is no tomorrow, but homie that shit is not a sport.  Sorry.  You run around on brooms and it is so weird.  It's a game, can we at least settle on that?  Game, yes, sport, LOL FUCK NO.  I am almost 1000% positive that your make or break relationship moments are different than mine, maybe a little more true to life, but hopefully this video makes you realize that they are in fact real moments.  Maybe write them down in a diary so then you can laugh at all the funny ones when you're old and have no idea where you are but you're high off happy pills and everyone is super nice but you're bored of playing scrabble that day because you already played like six games with Larry and you want another fun activity to do.  You know, leave yourself some options.  If a spaceship was made out of marshmallows, oh boy would you need a big graham cracker! \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!
